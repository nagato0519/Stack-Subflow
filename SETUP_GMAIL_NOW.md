# 🚀 Quick Gmail Setup - Final Step

Your welcome email feature is **fully implemented** and ready to go! Just add these two lines to your `.env.local` file.

## ✅ What's Already Done

1. ✅ Welcome email API route created (`/app/api/send-welcome-email/route.ts`)
2. ✅ Integration with payment flow completed
3. ✅ Beautiful HTML email template with Japanese content
4. ✅ nodemailer package installed
5. ✅ Error handling and logging implemented

## 📝 What You Need To Do (30 seconds)

### Step 1: Open your `.env.local` file

```bash
# In your project root directory
open .env.local
# or use your code editor
code .env.local
```

### Step 2: Add these TWO lines to the file

```env
EMAIL_SENDER=contact@stack-community.org
EMAIL_PASSWORD=xtytbokcvsxgewiq
```

**Important Notes:**
- ⚠️ The password should have **NO SPACES**: `xtytbokcvsxgewiq` (not `xtyt bokc vsxg ewiq`)
- ⚠️ Make sure there are no extra quotes or spaces around the values
- ⚠️ Place these lines after your existing environment variables

### Step 3: Restart your development server

```bash
# Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing

After restarting the server:

1. Go to `/signup` in your browser
2. Create a test account
3. Complete the payment (use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`)
4. Check the terminal logs for:
   ```
   [Welcome Email] Email sent successfully
   ```
5. Check your email inbox (the email entered during signup)
6. Also check the SPAM folder, just in case

## 📧 What the Email Contains

The welcome email will automatically send:
- ✅ Welcome message in Japanese
- ✅ User's login credentials (email + password)
- ✅ Link to download the Stack app from App Store
- ✅ Security reminder
- ✅ Beautiful professional design

## 🔍 How It Works

```
User Signs Up → Payment Successful → Account Created → Welcome Email Sent → Success Page
```

The email is sent automatically after:
1. Payment is confirmed
2. Firebase Auth account is created
3. Firestore user document is created

## 📋 Email Preview

**Subject:** ようこそ、Stackへ 🎉

**Content:**
- Welcoming message
- Login credentials displayed clearly
- App download link
- Professional Stack branding
- Security warning

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Email not sending?

Check the server console for errors. Common issues:

1. **Environment variables not loaded**
   - Make sure you restarted the dev server after editing `.env.local`
   
2. **Authentication failed**
   - Verify the password has no spaces: `xtytbokcvsxgewiq`
   - Verify the email is correct: `contact@stack-community.org`
   - Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled on this Gmail account

3. **Email going to spam**
   - This is normal for new senders
   - Ask recipients to mark as "Not Spam"

### Check the logs

Look for these messages in your terminal:

✅ Success:
```
[Welcome Email] Email sent successfully
```

❌ Error:
```
[Welcome Email] Error sending email
```

1. Go to your project settings
2. Add Environment Variables:
   - `EMAIL_SENDER` = `contact@stack-community.org`
   - `EMAIL_PASSWORD` = `xtytbokcvsxgewiq`
3. Redeploy
