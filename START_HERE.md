## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Email not sending?

**Quick fix**: Run the test script
```bash
node test-email.js your@email.com
```

The test script will tell you exactly what's wrong.

### Common issues:

1. **"Email service not configured"**
   - Add EMAIL_SENDER and EMAIL_PASSWORD to `.env.local`
   - Restart server

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Remove spaces from password: `gljjgeybuyuubypn`
   - Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled on Gmail

3. **"Email goes to spam"**
   - Normal for new senders
   - Mark as "Not Spam" in your email client

For detailed troubleshooting, see `FINAL_SETUP_STEPS.md`.
