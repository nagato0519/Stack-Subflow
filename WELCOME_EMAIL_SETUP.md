# Welcome Email Feature - Setup Complete ‚úÖ

This document summarizes the welcome email feature that has been added to your Stack application.

## What Was Added

### 1. Email Sending API Route
**File**: `/app/api/send-welcome-email/route.ts`

This API endpoint handles sending welcome emails to new users after successful signup and payment.

**Features:**
- Beautiful HTML email template with Japanese content
- Plain text fallback for email clients that don't support HTML
- Includes user's login credentials (email & password)
- Link to App Store for downloading the Stack app
- Professional styling matching Stack brand

### 2. Integration with Signup Flow
**File**: `/app/subscribe/page.tsx`

The subscribe page now automatically sends a welcome email after:
1. ‚úÖ Payment is successful
2. ‚úÖ Firebase Auth account is created
3. ‚úÖ Firestore user document is created
4. ‚úÖ Welcome email is sent

**Important**: The email sending doesn't block the user flow - even if the email fails to send, the user will still be redirected to the success page.
